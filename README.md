# Shane Gravestock Portfolio
A React.js based website that allows for easy reuse of components, so that it can stay up to date easily and will be readily available without much downtime

The main achievement of this website is the amount of reuse that the main components of the gallery are being used - this allows for an easy state change update which renders a new gallery object as well as a new template for the video to play

## Further Compatibility
Being future proof is a big concern - I've made it so that in the future, if necessary a flux model and a cms can be added to make it even easier for the client to add new content, and further expansion of the website (such as a blog) can be easily and readily added

## Speed
Loading videos can be very strenuous, and the old wordpress based website was extremely slow - as well as making it hard to add new content. Two of the main issues the client had at hand, which can be easily done now - with a one page styled website which is loaded as fast as possible to ensure that possible clients do not leave their page
